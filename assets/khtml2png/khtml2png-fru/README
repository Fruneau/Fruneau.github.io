khtml2png2
==========

khtml2png is a command line program to create screenshots of webpages. It uses
libkhtml (the library that is used in the KDE webbrowser Konqueror) and 
"convert" from the ImageMagick graphic conversion toolkit.


Requirements
============
For running and compiling you need some libraries and tools. You can find the
Debian package names in braces.

	* g++
	* KDE 3.x
	* kdelibs for KDE 3.x (kdelibs4-dev)
	* zlib (zlib1g-dev)
	* cmake


Introducing informations
========================
Extract the archive with: tar xfvz <file name>

Afterwards check the requirements and install missing development packages.


Compiling and installation
==========================
This is done with the usual three steps

	1. ./configure
	2. make
	3. make install


Static file
===========
If you have chosen the precompiled statically linked file you don't need to
install KDE or KDE librariers. Just extract the file with

	bunzip2 <file name>

and place it in a directory used for binaries (e.g. /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin).
If you like you can rename the executable.
!!! Make sure the khtml2png2 file is executable (e.g. chmod +x <file name>). !!!
